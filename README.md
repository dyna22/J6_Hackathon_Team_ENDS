opencv-python==3.4.2.16
opencv-contrib-python==3.4.2.16
so,
1. u should install all these using pip install command
2. now u can run Recognition.py and set Trackbars values to controll of Image lighting
3. put your hand in the rectangle and test any alphabet sign language
4. if u want to make a word -> after detect the alphabet letter press on c in your keyboard then take another letter and press on c and so on until finish your word if your word  bigger than 14 characters it will be saved in text file named temp
5. if u want to add any new sign run Capture.py and name your new sign and press c to take more photo to your first sign Do that for any time of signs then take this new Dataset and make your own model
6. to test these new Dataset should return to Recognition.py file and change the model with your new model and little change in the code if you use an if's conditions or u can read it from labels file if u make
